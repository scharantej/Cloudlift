## Flask Application Design for Creating a Google Cloud Sales Plan

### HTML Files

- `index.html`: This file will serve as the landing page and main user interface for creating a sales plan. It should include a form with fields for collecting the customer's information, current infrastructure details, and desired benefits from Google Cloud.

- `sales_plan.html`: This file will display the generated sales plan, including the analysis of the customer's current infrastructure, migration strategy, cost analysis, timeline for implementation, and recommendations for maximizing Google Cloud benefits.

### Routes

- `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file, allowing the user to access the sales plan creation form.

- `/create_sales_plan`: This route will handle the form submission from `index.html`. It will collect the user's input and generate a personalized sales plan. The generated sales plan will be rendered in the `sales_plan.html` file.

- `/download_sales_plan`: This route will allow the user to download the generated sales plan as a PDF or other suitable format.
